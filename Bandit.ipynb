    "**What?** Compare different versions of something to figure out which one is better, can be used as an alternative to AB testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** To *mitigate the regret* introduced in AB test, the regret about the lost conversion you experience while sending people to the potentially worse variation in a test. Rather than splitting people to two groups and run a test, the algorithm updates the split through the experiment, pulling the winning slot machine arm most often, i.e. it moves traffic towards the winning variation gradually.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How?** Starts by sending traffic to two (or more) pages: the original and the variation, then, in an attempt to *pull the winning slot machine arm most often*, the algorithm updates based on whether or not a variation is ‘winning'. (There is also the randomization part though - the randomization of for example 10% - these trials would be used to explore the options, no matter the winning arm. It is a trade-off between trying new things in hopes of something better, and sticking with what it knows will work.)\n",

    "- Example of reinforcement task\n",
    "- Explore/exploit trade-off task in sequential decision problems\n",
    "- Many algorithms available for this task\n",
    " - Thompson Sampling, one of the earliest ones actually, it is a Bayesian algorithm: The basic idea is to choose an arm to play according to its probability of being the true best arm. \n",

    "Given a set of actions with some unknown reward distributions which get better understood with the time in the experiment, the agent needs to allocate between competing choices for long-term reward maximization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find the optimal solution, we need to explore all the actions to gain additional information, but at the same time, exploit the best action to maximize the expected reward, all while having limited resources.\n",

    "- At each step there are k bandits, we select one by an action $a \\in {a_1,..a_k}$\n",
    "- Each bandit has a reward $r$ associated with it - 0,1 in our case\n",
    "- The reward for each action $r_a = P(r \\ | \\ a) $ is unknown\n",
    "- The reward distribution with unknown parameters is to be learned sequentially\n",
    "- Meaning, when played, each arm has $\\theta_k$ probability of reward 1, each $\\theta_k$ can be interpreted as an action’s success probability or mean reward. The mean rewards $\\theta = \\theta_1,..\\theta_k$ are unknown, but fixed over time. \n",
    "- Pulling the arm produces a reward r which is sampled from the underlying distribution for that bandit\n",
    "- The goal is to choose action at each time $a_t$ to maximize the reward $\\sum_t r_{a_i,t}$, where $r_{a_i,t} \\sim P_{a_i}$\n",
    "- The arm rewards are stochastic, therefore we concentrate on maximising the expected total reward $\\sum E(\\sum_t r_{a_i,t})$\n",
    "- I.e., actually, the goal is to minimize the regret\n",
    "- What is the optimal arm? Different techniques.\n",
    "- Easy way out would be to select each bandit one by one at a uniform rate, keep track of the rewards, then go back to the one that paid out the most (i.e. you are assessing the underlying probability distribution), but each time you spend experimenting takes you away from maximizing your reward. You are probably getting less than if you would go with the current optimal lever.\n",
    "- Or second, keep pulling the bandit that gave you the max reward - here you are missing on collecting the information about the other arms that is valuable in finding the best overall arm in the long term.\n",
    "- this trade-off creates the **explore-exploit dilemma**, there are different possible solutions, such as\n",
    " - *The Epsilon-greedy agent* assigns $(1- \\epsilon)$ to exploit the current ‘best’ bandit, and $\\epsilon$: towards exploring better bandits\n",
    " - *Thomspon Sampling* randomly allocates observations to arms according the Bayesian posterior probability that each arm is optimal, it assumes a simple prior distribution on the parameters of the reward distribution of every arm, and at any time step, play an arm according to its posterior probability of being the best arm."
